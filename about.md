I am a believer in the unity of scientific pursuits and domain-general learning over partitioned endeavours. My intellectual interests are diverse and range from poetry to machine learning. I keep a more serious intellectual account [here](http://erikdrysdale.com).

The philosophy of this blog is as follows:

<i>Read ideas are far less valuable that unread ones. One's studies should only be limited by the time one is required to sacrifice in order to effectively bid in today's tight real estate market. One should aim to learn as much as a dedicated reader would in the Library of Alexandria with a Methuselah-length life span. One will not let one's scholarship lead to the pitfalls of the Academy of Lagado. One will accumulate more ideas and a growing sense of one's ignorance as one ages, and the rising number of intellectual blind spots will leave one increasingly humble. One will call this world view influenced by the sheer magnitude of known- and unknown-unknowns skeptical empiricism.</i>
