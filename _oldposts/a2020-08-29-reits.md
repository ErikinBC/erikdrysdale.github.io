The choice of whether or not to buy a home is an especially difficult one for millenials. Many of Canada's largest urban centres have seen years of above-inflation house price growth. Because Canada is an [urban country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_by_country) (82%) and the majority of job growth has taken place in cities like Toronto, renters have seen most of their real wage gains wiped out rental price increases (which tend to track prices). As the average renter spends anywhere from [29-36%](http://poll.forumresearch.com/data/42647a5a-bd83-4ee0-b3ed-0dc55f02279cMississauga_Cost%20of%20Living_.pdf) of their income on rent, rental prices increases of 5-15% are easily enough to wipe out real wage increases.[[^1]] Since 2000 most residential house prices and rents in Canada have become sufficiently volatile and disconnected from local labour markets that **housing services have become the equivalent of a foreign currency for renters**.[[^2]] Like any asset that one is compelled to buy, their exists a strong opportunity for a [hedging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)) strategy that would help offset losses to real income from changes in resendtial house prices. 

In this post I will analyze how well Canada's largest real estate investment trusts ([REITs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment_trust)) serve in provided a hedge to price growth in Canada's largest cities. While analysis below uses Toronto house prices as the benchmark, this can be easily modified in the code.

## (1) Background

Housing is a horrible investment vehicle *in theory*. An ideal asset is 1) liquid, 2) diversified, and 3) uncorrelated with other income streams. Residential real estate fails to satisfy all three of these properties. Housing is difficult to sell and has large transaction fees (illiquid). It is a single-asset class (undiversified). Assuming you are employed in the city you live in, a housing market slump will likely be associated with local economic shocks which imply an increased probability of unemployment. 

Investing 101 says that owning a *single* stock is a bad idea. Even though a given company could see its share price increase by 30% in a given year, it could also fall by a large amount. In contrast, owning ten stocks in ten different sectors will reduce the probability of a large price increase or decrease.[[^3]] The same principle applies to owning a house. Even if a city's house price growth was stable in aggregate, within a neighbourhood there can be large price swings due to re-zoning, gentrification, natural disasters, construction projects, and many other forces. 

Housing markets also share the unfortunate characteristic that they are highly cyclical. When the local economy is doing well prices will go up. But if a local industry collapses then workers will lose their jobs, housing prices will fall, and a cascade of defaults can occur. One of the reasons for the 2008 financial crisis was the large amount of leverage that the banking sector took on. A 10% equity stake in a home means you are levered 9:1. At this ratio, a 10% price increase a 100% return on investment whereas as 10% price decline means you are wiped out. Leverage therefore magnifies returns. This argument makes housing  of this makes housing look like a terrible idea.

However two-thirds of Canadian households [own their house](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171025/dq171025c-eng.htm) and more than 80% think home ownership is a [good investment](http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/news/2017/20170410-homeownership.html). Why is there a disconnect between economic theory and real people actually want to invest in? One reason might be culture. In North America the real estate industry has turned home ownership into a cultural good that signifies middle-class respectability. The power imbalance between tenants and land-lords may also create a yearning for independence via ownership. Housing is also tied up with family, marriage, and many other factors that are hard to disentangle from pecuniary interests. The fact that wealthy societies like [Switzerland and Germany](https://tinyurl.com/ogmaoxe) have home ownership rates below 55% suggests that cultural forces may a factor. I am more inclined to believe that policy is the demand-side culprit. First, and most crucially, a Canadian taxpayer's principal residence is [excluded](https://tinyurl.com/yc8b7cn6) from capital gains tax. Whereas an [RRSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_retirement_savings_plan) or [TFSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax-free_savings_account) account has limits on the amount of tax-free earnings that can be sheltered in Canada, no such limit exists for the primary residence. As a result, literally hundreds of billions of dollars of capital gains have gone untaxed in the last twenty years.

Given that a millenial household living in Vancouver or Toronto would need to obtain a mortgage of more than a million dollars to buy a semi-detached house, or more than half-a-million for a condo, it is not suprising that many are reluctant to jump into the property market. However the fear of waiting too late and being priced out of the market is also not an unreasonable one given the empirical data in the last 20 years (discussed in Section 2 below). One way for individuals to track some of the gains of the housing market without needing to obtain a mortgage at the maximum amortization period is to diligently invest part of their portfolio into REITs which track the market. REITs share the advantage of other stocks in that they are liquid, and are similar to ETFs in that they hold a bundle of assets helping to improve liquidity. Since REITs are designed to pay dividends at the maximum sustainable level, they are well suited to being held in an RRSP or TFSA where such dividends can be accumulated tax free and re-invested without penalty. Unless one is investing with a margin account, REITs will never be able to obtain the magnitude of returns that a leveraged home buyer will have (assuming house price growth is positive of course). However individuals that plan on being renters for the forseable future in one of Canada's largest cities would still benefit from having a partial edge against future rent increases. 

## (2) Key Canadian housing/employment figures

In this section I want to highlight the magnitude of houisng and labour markets imbalances in the Canadian economy. There is a partially accurate folk wisdom that "*all the jobs*" are being created in the  matches the trends in the data. As the data shows below, Canada's big cities do play a disproportionate rule in job creation. At the same time, there is a crisis in housing affordability in those same markets that have seen above-averaged job growth. This is indisputably true. Housing prices in many cities have grown not just above inflation and economic growth, but even compared to other financial assets.

The code below pulls the relevant Labour Force Survey data fom StatsCan tables along with the [Teranet](https://housepriceindex.ca/) House Price Index data.[[^5]] The Teranet index is the most reliable measure of fundamental changes to housing prices in Canada since it only measures changes in price for a given house which has been sold more than once. This provides an natural way to avoid confounding factors that go into the composition of home sales such as housing type (e.g. apartments versus single-family homes) or the quality of houses (e.g. luxury neighbouhoods). 

<IMG>FIGURE 1 GOES HERE</IMG>

Figure 1 above shows the share of net employment creation broken down by metropolitan area as well as the share of the overall adult population. Toronto, Calgary/Edmonton, and Vancouver/Victoria have generated net employment growth well above their respective population shares in recent years. Depsite Quebec a relative economic laggard in Canada, even Montreal is now performing better that its population share would suggest. These four urban clusters have gone from making up 47% to 63% of all new employment opportunities in Canada. 

<IMG>FIGURE 2 GOES HERE</IMG>

The nominal and real price increases in Canadian house prices is truly staggering as Figure 2 shows. While Calgary saw prices begin to sky-rocket starting prices in 2006, the nominal highs reached by 2008 are around the same level today. Alberta's economic fortunes have been sealed by low global oil prices, limited diversification, and a failure of infrastructure projects to enable oil transportation. Compared to 20 years ago, nominal home prices high risen by a factor of three to four in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. This roughly roughly equates to annualized growth rates of 6%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. In contrast the consumer price level has increased by at most 50%. Even if one invested in the [S&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index) after the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) and 9/11, the annualized rate of return on equities would be roughly 6%.  

For Canadian households which have been observing these price changes the psychological effects have been profound. The [fear of missing out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) means that Canadian households are more willing to leverage themselves to get large mortgages. Canada's household debt-to-income ratio [is 177%](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=3810023801), putting our country near the top in [world comparisons](https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-debt.htm). Most of this household debt, unsurprisingly, is made up of mortgages (65%). Even though renters do not necessarily experience higher rents in any given year because of rent controls and the stickiness of contracts, in the long run rents will necessarily rise since rental units can ultimately be resold as condos for homebuyers and investors. For example CMHC [reports](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/data-and-research/data-tables/rental-market-report-data-tables) that rental prices rose by 5.7%, 6.5%, and 6.0% in 2019, for Montreal Toronto, and Vancouver, which was close to the increase in property prices.[[^6]] In other words house price increases will always catch up wither renters in the long run.

## (3) Canadian REITs

In this section I will show how to pull the stock price, dividend payments, and balance sheet information for all of Canada's  [publically traded](https://reitreport.ca/canadian-reits/) REITs.[[^4]]

Even if a stock price followed a an exponential distribution (which has fatter tails) the decrease in probability would be by a factor of almost 7000 (`pexp(3,lower.tail = F)/pgamma(q=3*10,shape=10,rate=1,lower.tail = F)`!
