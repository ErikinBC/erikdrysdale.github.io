<h1> About me </h1>

<p> My name is Erik Drysdale and I work as a Data Scientist and Bioinformatician at SickKids Hospital in the <a href="http://goldenberglab.ca/">Goldenberg</a> and <a href="http://lab.research.sickkids.ca/yeung/">Yeung</a> Labs. My professional responsibilities include leading the data science component of an international pediatric autoimmune study as well as variety of machine learning projects in the biomedical research space including predicting return visits to the emergency department and predicting sepsis onset in the ICU. My  research interests are focused on the intersection of classical statistics and machine learning methods such as high-dimensional inference, sparsity-based approaches, and survival analysis. </p>
