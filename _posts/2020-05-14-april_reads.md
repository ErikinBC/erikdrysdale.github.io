### Book #1: Indian Tales by Rudyard Kipling

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/indian_tales.jpg" width="16%"></p>
<br>

Being the *Bard of Empire* has proven a long-run liability for Kipling's enduring appeal among modern audiences. Even as someone who has a fairly high tolerance and moderate nostalgia for *Pax Britannica*, some of Kipling's verse is unbearably cringe worthy. One of his most famous, *[Gunda Din](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46783/gunga-din)*, which is found in many English poetry collections ends with "... Though I've belted you and flayed you ... You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!"*. Charming. Or Boris Johnson's [favourite poem](http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_mandalay.htm) to bring up during diplomatic missions: *"Ship me somewheres east of Suez, where the best is like the worst. / Where there aren't no Ten Commandments an' a man can raise a thirst"*. Despite not having aged well, Kipling is still a remarkable wordsmith and, like many of the problematic classics, should be read in order to understand the psyche of the time. 

My collection of *Indian Tales* by Rudyard Kipling is from 1899 by H. M. Caldwell Company purchased by my partner for me at a rare book fair. It contains 35 short stories and 16 illustrations, mainly containing the works Kipling wrote when he was a journalist and living in Allahabad from 1883-89. The most well-known stories are found in Kipling's earlier publications including *[Wee Willie Winkie]*(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wee_Willie_Winkie_and_Other_Child_Stories) and *[The Phantom Rickshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_%27Rickshaw_and_Other_Tales)*. The stories I found most engaging were the ghost ghost stories, especially *The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes*, which reminded me of Browning's *[Childe Roland](https://www.bartleby.com/246/654.html)*. I also found the descriptions of battles in stories like *The Drums of the Fore and Aft* to be quite engaging. Having been written less than a decade after the [second Anglo-Afghan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Anglo-Afghan_War), it is unsurprising that the military themes are around British regiments fighting against the ferocious [Ghazi's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazi_(warrior)) armed with [jezails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezail) fighting in loose formation against the disciplined formation of the red coats. Despite showing up in around a third of the stories, I was not particularly moved by the *[Three Musketeers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learoyd,_Mulvaney_and_Ortheris)* of the *Indian Tales*: privates Learoyd, Mulvaney, and Ortheris. Kipling's use of cockney dialect and slang feels well done, but like some of the comic relief in a Shakespeare play, their humour and slapstick did not land for me.

I am happy that *Indian Tales* is part of my library now, but for many readers it will be an acquired taste. At a minimum it is an excellent view into the imperial mind of an Englishmen living at the height of the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj). Kipling is unabashed in using a variety of Indian slang throughout the novel, and the characters and settings feel thoroughly "Indian", from an [Anglo-Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Indian) perspective of course. The most famous story of this collection *The Man Who Would Be King* emphasizes the view that the English thought of themselves as gods in relation to the locals in the spirit of the [White Rajahs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rajahs). The supremacist view embedded in Victorian empire has made it difficult for future generations of either Indians or Europeans to have an open or honest assessment of the the historical legacy of British rule in terms of the economic, political, or as in Kipling's case, the artistic. 


### Book #2: The Death of Ivan Ilyich & Other Stories by Leo Tolstoy

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/ivan_ilyich.jpg" width="16%"></p>
<br>

In the book *Being Mortal* Atul Gawande references Tolstoy's short story *The Death of Ivan Ilyich* as an excellent reference for understanding why medicine fails today. Ivan is a successful lawyer and judge whose main ambitions in life is to ascend the social hierarchy. Even though his marriage and family life is unsatisfying, he feels his professional accomplishments are more than sufficient compensation. After suffering from a minor accident, a mysterious pain continues to grow in Ivan until his burdensome illness strips him off his career and vaulted social standing. While a plethora of medical men visit Ivan and diagnose him with every conceivable disease, at no point does anyone ask or give Ivan what he wants: the be healed. Once Ivan understands that he will die he wants to be comforted as a child would be. By failing to acknowledge his vulnerability, Ivan is left existentially bare. Only one character in the story, Gerasim, an uneducated peasant, is able to provide the physical healing that Ivan so desperately craves. By the simple act of holding his legs to reduce his pain, Ivan Ilyich takes succor is the strength and vitality of a younger mans bodies. It is not a homoerotic relationship, instead it is the closest physical manifestation Ivan comes to receiving the cooing embraces he so desperately desires. 

*The Death of Ivan Ilyich* is the best story to be found in Richard Pevear and Liarissa Volokhonsky's translation of Tolstoy's most famous shorter works. This translator-couple pair has tackled many other [Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_literature#Golden_Age) works including most of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy's epics, as well as Gogol, Bulgakov, and Chekhov. The translation feels fresh and well suited to the 21st century. Two of Tolstoy's stories set in the Caucasus: *The Prisoner of the Caucasus* and *Hajdi Murat* has also aged quite well and feel particularly relevant to understanding both Islam in the region as well as Russia's brutal [Chechen wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War). Despite being a devout Christian, Tolstoy is able to write from a Muslim perspective with great empathy. 

Other stories in the novel were more hit and miss. Some stories, like *The Forged Coupon*, had very engaging beginnings but ran out of steam half way. Others, like *Father Sergius*, were more consistent throughout but less interesting over all. Tolstoy's religiosity shows up in several manifestations. A clear theme of sexual guilt runs throughout several stories including *The Kreutzer Sonata* to *The Devil* -- where in the latter the protagonist kills himself to prevent him from engaging in adultery. Like a good Christian, Tolstoy treats even the most sinful characters with generosity (*Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do*). The characters most obsessed with the material are  punished in this world when a significant loss lays bare the shallowness of the life and ambition (e.g. Vassily Andreich in *Master and Man*). Tolstoy's fiction is also interesting in that many of the characters were real historical figures such as [Prince Vorontsov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Semyonovich_Vorontsov). For readers interested in a modern translation of Tolstoy's works without having to tackle a thousand page sprawling epic, Pevear and Volohkonsky's *Stories* may be a good place to start. 

### Book #3: Getting Things Done by David Allen

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/gettingthingsdone.jpg" width="16%"></p>
<br>

In the early 20th century the range of activities comprising the work was defined and discrete: milking the cows, saudering a plate of iron, etc. Now work has become "edgeless" and this may end up creating more work as we are unsure what constitutes finishing something. Add to this the unlimited information available on the internet, and one feels as though a task could always be done better. To-do lists and calendars were a very sensible tool for a labour force transitioning into the modern service economy. However, such checklists are fragile to rapidly evolving situations and workflows. 

Horizontal vs vertical scanning. 

*Rearranging incomplete lists of unclear things.*

*You don't manage priorities you have them. The key to managing all your "stuff" is managing your actions.*

The three strategies to making commitments:

1. All unfinished projects must be logged in an external system (collection bucket) and not in your mind. You must trust that you will come back to this repository so you don't need to think about it.
2. Clarify what satisfies the commitment or what constitutes progress in fulfilling it.
3. Have a reminder system for following up on the external system. 


> Time if that quality of nature that keeps events from happening all at once. Lateley it doesn't seem to be working.
> 
> The hurrier I go, the behinder I get.
>
> The winds and waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators (Edward Gibbon)
> 
> Rule your mind or it will rule you. (Horace)
> 
> Vision is not enough; it must be combined with venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps; we must step up the stairs.

> There is usually an inverse proportion between how much something is on your mind and how much it's getting done. 



### Book #4: Warfare in the Eighteen Century by Jeremy Black

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/warfare18th.jpg" width="16%"></p>
<br>


Very balanced focus on non-European conflicts. Many people know about the [Battle of Plassey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plassey) and [Robert Clive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Clive), but what about [Third Battle of Panipat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Panipat) and [Ahmad Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Shah_Durrani), which may have been the largest land conflict in the 18th century. Many great less-known generals including Nadir Shah who revived the Persian empire and fought battles ranging from Baghdad, the Caucasus, the Aral Sea, and all the way to Delhi. 

The 18th century was also when the Chinese state under the Manchus and Qianliang's (?) reached its geographic and military apex. Important battles were fought to finally destroy the Dsungars, the last remaining vestiges of the Mongols and secure the western frontier which ranged from Central Asia, Mongolia, and Tibet. China's lack of maritime power means that it had little conflict with those outside its adjoining neighbours.

Warfare between Europeans and non-Europeans can be decomposed into three categories: battles on European borders (mainly in Eurasia), battles between white settlers and native forces in the Americas, and battles by European armies in territories outside of Europe (i.e. Asian and African colonial wars). 

Black stresses that military outcomes in much of the 18th century had very little to do with the sophistication of military technology, and more to do with the prowess in diplomacy, logistics, and state capacity. Indeed the range of weapons used by the Chinese army in the 18th century, for example, would have approximately matched 16th century European firearms including the relatively unreliable matchlock rifles. 

Contrary to what might be expected, Europeans fared poorly in military engagements in Asia during the 18th century. This fact may be counter to one's expectations given the colonial momentum that was seen in the 17th century and the dominance that was obtained in the 19th. The 17th century saw European powers like the Dutch, Portuguese, and French establishing toeholds along many Asian coastal locations. The 18th century was the beginning of the end of Dutch colonial power, with a series of unsuccessful conflicts in the East Indies and Ceylon. The French were driven out of some of the Indian holdings. No European power in the 18th century had any military presence in China, Japan, or Burma. The British were unique in that they obtained significant territorial and military victories. Although they also saw defeat at the hands of the [Kingdom of Mysore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Mysore), and the [Maratha Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Empire) remained an imposing force. Even then victories in the Indian subcontinent were largely a result of a the failure of native empires to unite against the European threat and the recruitment of local forces as either sepoys or independent cavalry regiments to bolster the ranks of the British forces. Like the Spanish conquistidors, achievement was more a function of a unified administrative state and a divided opposition, rather than a massive divergence in firepower (which would be seen in the 19th century with the use of breech-loading rifles and machine guns).
