### Introduction

What is economics? Clearly it is what economists [do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Viner). But despite this unsatisfying albeit amusing quip there is little coherence in the public or professional mind as to what exactly our métier does with all its spare time. Some would say that we are busy becoming [rich](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/09/29/lifetime_earnings_by_college_major_why_economics_grads_make_bank.html) or dominating the [social sciences](http://flash.lakeheadu.ca/~kyu/E5111/Lazear2000.pdf) but I think we will need to look to [Keynes](http://www.aspeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/content/upload/Intro_Session1.pdf)[[^1]] for inspiration.

> If economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble, competent people, on a level with dentists, that would be splendid!

## Footnotes

[^1]: Pronounced "kayhns".  

[^2]: Furthermore, these same textbooks make it clear that normative economics is what is discussed during Democratic Primaries and positive economics is what lines the pages of the august Journal of the American Economic Association. As a side note, in economics, the elite American universities dominate the intellectual discourse of the field through both their prestige and gravitational pull on all aspiring academicians. The Journal of the American Economic Association is to economics what Nature is to the sciences. 

[^3]: I say ‘public’ deliberately because many would argue that the field began to move on from its classical origins of Adam Smith and David Ricardo by the publication of Principals of Economics by Alfred Marshall in 1890s.

[^4]: I don't want this sentiment to be misinterpreted as I would not want economists to have to go through the equivalent of a bar exam, as professional accreditations are in part a form of rent seeking. However, a voluntary association for professional standards seems like a good compromise. 

[^5]: For example, how the relative importance of fixed costs for businesses changes the competitive pressures in a market.

[^6]: By this I meant that stable constants and parameters are preferred over evolutionary processes.

[^7]: Again, I don't want this sentiment to misinterpreted either! This project was of course staggeringly complex when compared to the everyday professional activities normal persons carry out. All I mean is that the physical rules that govern space travel are more comprehensive and tractable that say the folding of a protein or understanding the immune system.
