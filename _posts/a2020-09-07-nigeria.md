## Background

Seventeen African countries achieved independence in the year [1960](https://www.thoughtco.com/chronological-list-of-african-independence-4070467). Among this list was Nigeria, the continent's most populated country and the regional leader of West Africa. The disintegration of the British and French empires happened faster than almost anyone would have predicted five years before. Though each country's independence experience was [unique](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/africa_since_independence/), each often shared a similar set of challenges. Borders based on a European [scramble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa) for colonial possessions meant that nation states often had an unwieldy collection of competing ethnic groups each with access to different natural resources. Because the colonial authorities were concerned that mass education would make indirect rule politically impossible, there were only a handful of educated elites at the time of independence who were capable of running the country. No country embodied the twin problems of problematic borders and diffuse ethnic coalitions more so than Nigeria. The crippled giant's fascinating and turbulent history since independence is covered in Richard Bourne's *Nigeria: A New History of a Troubled Century*. The book is written for a popular audience and little background knowledge is needed for a novice reader to enjoy it. However an understanding of some West African history and knowledge of Nigeria's key historical figures will enhance the reading experience.

> Anyone who claims to understand Nigeria is either deluded, or a liar. It comprises so many ethnicities and perspectives, with a contest past and statistics to be taken with pinches of salt, that it is an act of immodest to write a centenary history. 

Nigeria's demographic challenges can be decomposed into three dimensions. A Muslim and Christian divide can be seen between the north and south of the country. Although internal migration has been common since the colonial era and congregants of either religion are numerous in both region. For example the [Sabon Gari's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabon_Gari) of the North were the ghettos where Southerners tended to reside. At independence the North of the country was seen as sociologically backward compared to the Christian south. As part of [Lugard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Lugard,_1st_Baron_Lugard) indirect rule policy,[[^0]] the Northern emirs were given free reign over local administration, with fealty only to overarching British foreign policy. Many of the Nigerian troops that fought with the British in WWII (see the [81st](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/81st_(West_Africa)_Division_) and [82nd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_(West_Africa)_Division_)) were drawn from Northern regions and the emirs even donated to war cause. The British in turn helped the emirs keep out Christian missionaries and southern agitators. As a result there were almost no formal schools in Northern Nigeria at the time of the independence (beyond the Islamic madrassas) and the vast majority of the population was illiterate.[[^x1]]

A strange phenomena that often happened in the British empire was the romanticism of a specific ethnic group in the country (often the one that most reminded the officer class of the Scots). For example the "Pathans" (e.g. [Pashtuns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtuns)) were seen as the noble light-skinned and green-eyed warriors in contrast to the sycophantic "Hindoos" of the Indian subcontinent.[[^1]] Lugard, and many other Nigerian Governors, was more sympathetic to the Northern Islamic state with its clear feudal hierarchies and [Durbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbar_festival) pageantry. Lugard was actually responsible for the military capture of Northern Nigeria with a force of only 2000 troops and 200 British officers. However the Maxim gun and British discipline enabled the capture of the North's major cities (Kano, Sokoto, Katsina, Zaria) and the concomitant capitulations of the Fulani emirs.

> The vast majority of the inhabitants were not only completely unaware that they had been allocated to Britain but were ignorant of the very existence of such a country. Nor were the bulk of these peoples primitive and unorganised tribesmen who subjection, when Britain was ready to claim it, could be taken for granted: the region contained some of the most highly developed and civilised Muslim states of tropical Africa, centred upon walled cities and defended by armies of horsemen.

Nigeria's second demographic split was along the three largest ethnic groups: the Hausa-Fulani in the North, the Yoruba in the South West and the Igbo in the South East. Despite the Igbo and Yoruba both being Christians,[[^2]] there has rarely been a stable "Christian" political coalition in Nigeria's history. Yet this ethnic trichotomy glosses over the numerous ethnic minorities that make up the rest of the country (about 33%). For example the well-known environmental activist [Ken Saro-Wiwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Saro-Wiwa) was an Ogoni and the former president [Goodluck Jonathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodluck_Jonathan) was an Ijaw. Bourne does a good job at avoiding simplistic narratives about "ancient hatreds" throughout his book when explaining the country's shifting political tides.

As Nigeria careened towards independence in 1960 there was oscillating pressure to either centralize or federalize the country. Though a centralizing state would help to reduce the regional imbalances in the country, it would be the target of lobbying efforts by each groups for *their turn to eat*. The choice of the Nigerian elite to preserve the country as a whole, whatever the cost, has largely defined the country's subsequent history. One wonders whether a purely federated Nigerian state would have prevented the civil war from occurring or the unprecedented corruption and environmental damage the oil industry ended up costing the country. Some of the country's challenges would have been inevitable though. Under Britain's colonial rule large numbers of minorities moved into adjacent territory for economic opportunities.[[^3]] 
Each region had large numbers of minorities, both ethnic and religious within them. A clash about the imposition of Sharia law on Northern Christians by the Alkalis is a clear risk. And would could a central state have allowed the discovery of massive hydrocarbon reserves in the South East to enable a local government to exceed the economic clout of the federal government? Despite its tumultuous history, Nigeria remains a unified country today. 


## Independence

Nigeria's independence occurred at the height of the cold war. [Lumumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba) had been overthrown by a coup a month before in the Congo and the Cuban revolution was still fresh in the minds of the Americans. Luckily, from the Western perspective, the country's first prime minister [Abubakar Tafawa Belawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abubakar_Tafawa_Balewa) was a pious Muslim, conservative, and not at all interested in the Soviet bloc.

> How was it that Balewa became the first elected prime minister of a sovereign Nigeria, in what in retrospect was called the First Republic? Had the British, possibly for Cold War reasons, fixed the 1959 elections so that this cautious and Anglophile northerner, with several wives as a good Muslim and 22 children, became the leader at independence? 

Probably not. Even though the two Southern Parties, the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons ([NCNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Nigeria_and_the_Cameroons)) and Action Group ([AG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Group_(Nigeria))),[[^4]] had enough seats to form a majority coalition, the Northern People's Congress ([NPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_People%27s_Congress)) went into a coalition with the NCNC to form government. [Awolowo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obafemi_Awolowo) and the Yoruba-dominated AG overplayed their hand by trying to make deals with the NPC and NCNC simultaneously. When they were discovered doing so, they were left as the opposition. When Nigeria became a Republic in 1963, the British government still had a large degree of influence in the fledgling country. Though the country was already showing a tendency towards ethno-regional political coalitions, the [Macmillan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Macmillan) government was happy enough that Nigeria remain a friendly member of the commonwealth. The Labour government was desperate to distance itself from the embarrassment of [Nkrumahism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Nkrumah) in Ghana, white flight in the Belgian Congo, and the South African apartheid government's [Sharpeville massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpeville_massacre). Nigeria was at a crossroad's at independence. [Nnamdi Azikiwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nnamdi_Azikiwe) in his inaugural address as Governor General appealed to Awolowo and the [Sardauna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadu_Bello) to forge a new country that was "hate-free, fear-free, and greed-free" and act as a shining example to the continent. Yet the dream would fail. In seven years Nigeria would experience two coups and one of the bloodiest civil wars in modern African history. 

> The trouble for Balewa and those trying to make a success of an independent Nigeria was that public expectations were excessive, the economy would have difficulty paying for them, and politics seemed the easiest way to make money. 'Nigeria' was becoming a deadly combination of a zero-sum game and roulette. The honeymoon joy of independence was the prologue to a deepening crisis. 

Though by no means aligned in the Soviet bloc, the Nigerian government began to chart its own foreign policy at odds with its former colonial ruler and NATO bloc. Nigeria became one of the most forceful critics of apartheid and racism more generally. It had protested France's nuclear tests in the Sahara and even temporarily ended diplomatic relations with her in 1963. This slight against France may have been the primary reason for French support of the Biafran rebels four years later. Nigeria also cancelled its defence treaty with the UK and become a full republic with 1963 severing all official links to the British monarchy. The country's size and importance would mean that decisions made in Nigeria would have a strong influence in the region and continent as a whole. 

## Overture to disaster

The political arrangements at the time of independence quickly began to fray within a few years. The NPC was much more successful than the NCNC in getting northerners into military and civil service positions. Cut off from the centre, the NCNC was focused mainly on shoring up its control of political officers held in Igboland. Even the opposition AG split into two halves with [Samuel Akintola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladoke_Akintola) leading a more "moderate" group that wanted to negotiate with the NPC whereas Awolowo continued to oppose any deals with the federal parliament and supported nationalization of key industries. 

> The United Peoples' Party then morphed into the Nigerian National Democratic Party, not becoming notably more democratic along the way. 

> Okotie-Eboh became notorious, like Kingsley Ozuomba Mbadiwe, Minister of Transport, as one of the 'ten per centers', the ministers who were collecting commissions on projects they approved... He triumphantly survived a storm in the House of Representatives after he had started a shoe factory and then increased the duty on imported shoes. 

The author was able to interview several important people in the book including Maitama Sule, the first and last resource minister who was not corrupt and who helped break up the Shell-BP and 'seven sisters' cartel on oil bidding. Sule also confirmed that Belawa also avoided the temptations of the corruptions. From all accounts Tafawa seems like a Muslim gentleman worthy of his Knighthood. It's important to note that "Balewa completely failed to call any of his ministers to account or punish them for their misdemeanours".

> The dissatisfaction with the Nigerian body politic was widespread, and it was displayed in the press, in the labour movement, in the dubious federal election at the end of 1964 and in its aftermath. At independence, only four years before, it would have been inconceivable that, so few years later, Chief Awolowo would have been incarcerated for treason in the 19th-century prison in Lagos. What few realized was that the anger with the slow pace of decolonisation and the corruption of the politicians was beginning to take hold in the military. 

As Chinua Achebe put it in his book *The Trouble with Nigeria*:

> The trouble with Nigeria is simply and squarely a failure of leadership. There is nothing basically wrong with the Nigerian character. There is nothing wrong with the Nigerian land or climate or water or air or anything else. The Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility, to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership.

## Civilian rule redux

The fathers of Nigeria's national consciousness like Macaulay, Azikiwe, and Awolowo began their education at a time of optimistic nationalism. Each chanelled their frustration and excitement into respective media outlets: the *Lagos Daily News*, *West African Pilot*, and *Nigerian Tribune*. Both Azikiwe and Awolowo would die when their country was ruled by military dictators (Abacha and Babangida, respectively). 


## Other thoughts

Glosses over how Nigeria actually got independence, and its context in West Africa more broadly. 

<br> 
* * *

[^0]: Lugard was not only the intellectual architect of [indirect rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_rule) but also that of the "dual mandate" which combined a [*mission civilisatrice*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilizing_mission) with economic exploitation for the mother country. Though indirect rule may have been well-suited to allow British traders and investors the ability to profit from resource extraction by co-opting existing tribal systems of government, it clearly was in tension with the "civilizing" project of abolishing slavery, for example. 

[^x1]: A notable exception to this was [Katsina College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barewa_College) which educated many of the Northern elite including Balewa, Bello, along with other presidents and military rulers. 

[^1]: Kipling's [Indian Tales](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/april_reads20/) are a good place to see the strange aspect of British racism on display.  

[^2]: It should be noted that the Igbo are disproportionately Catholic relative to the rest of the country. 

[^3]: The British invested a significant amount of resources into the development of the country's railways which allowed unprecedented internal mobility. From 1964 to 2003 the annual number of passengers [declined](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726153512/http://nannewsnigeria.com/news-analysis-overseeing-resurrection-nigerian-railways) from 11 to 1.6 million and freight traffic almost collapsed. The Lagos-Kano route which began in 1912 and has since disappeared may once again be [resurrected](https://www.globalconstructionreview.com/news/china-wins-67bn-lagos-kano-railway-contract/) by a Chinese state rail builder.

[^4]: The reader of Bourne's *Nigeria* cannot help but notice many of the fascinating characters make an appearance. One of the co-founders of the NCNC (along with Azikiwe), [Herbert Macauley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Macaulay) is one such a figure. Considered the father of the Nigerian independence movement, he was educated at a grammar school in Lagos in the late 19th century and went onto become the proprietor of the *Lagos Daily News* which was a constant thorn in the side of Lugard and the colonial authorities. Nigeria's claim to have the continents most rancorous and open media can be traced all the way back to Macaulay. He once memorably stated: "The dimensions of 'the true interests of the natives at heart' are algebraically equal to the length, breadth, and depth of the white man's pocket".
