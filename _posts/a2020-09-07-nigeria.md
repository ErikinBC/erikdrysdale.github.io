## Background

Seventeen African countries achieved independence in the year [1960](https://www.thoughtco.com/chronological-list-of-african-independence-4070467). Among this list was Nigeria, the continent's most populated country and the regional leader of West Africa. The disintegration of the British and French empires happened faster than almost anyone would have predicted five years before. Though each country's independence experience was [unique](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/africa_since_independence/), each often shared a similar set of challenges. Borders based on a European [scramble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa) for colonial possessions meant that nation states often had an unwieldy collection of competing ethnic groups each with access to different natural resources. Because the colonial authorities were concerned that mass education would make indirect rule politically impossible, there were only a handful of educated elites at the time of independence who were capable of running the country. No country embodied the twin problems of problematic borders and diffuse ethnic coalitions more so than Nigeria. The crippled giant's fascinating and turbulent history since independence is covered in Richard Bourne's *Nigeria: A New History of a Troubled Century*. The book is written for a popular audience and little background knowledge is needed for a reader to pick up the book. Having a rough sense of West African history and the important leaders in Nigeria's history will enhance the reading experience though.

Nigeria's demographic challenges can be decomposed into three dimensions. A Muslim and Christian divide can be seen between the north and south of the country, respectively. Although religious minorities are a large share of the populace in all parts of the country. At independence the North of the country had was seen as sociologically backward compared to the Christian south. As part of [Lugard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Lugard,_1st_Baron_Lugard) indirect rule policy, the Northern emirs were largely given free reign of local policy for adherence to British foreign policy. The British in turn helped the emirs keep out Christian missionaries and southern agitators. As a result there were almost no formal schools in Northern Nigeria at the time of the independence (beyond the Islamic madrassas) and the vast majority of the population was illiterate. 

A strange phenomena observed in the British empire was the romanticism of a specific ethnic group in the country (often the one that most reminded the officer class of the Scots). For example the "Pathans" (e.g. [Pashtuns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtuns)) were seen as the noble light-skinned and green-eyed warriors in contrast to the sycophantic "Hindoos" of the Indian subcontinent.[[^1]] Lugard, and many other Nigerian Governors, were more sympathetic to the Islamic state with its clear feudal hierarchies and [Durbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbar_festival) pageantry. The fact that the turn of the century was the height of the Arthurian obsession amongst the English is therefore hardly surprising.

Nigeria's second demographic split was along the three largest ethnic groups: the Hausa-Fulani in the North, the Yoruba in the South West and the Igbo in the South East. Despite the religious similarities of the Igbo and Yoruba, political coalitions between the different groups would often change throughout country's history. Yet this ethnic trichotomy glosses over the numerous ethnic minorities that make up the rest of the country (about 33%). For example the well-known environmental activist [Ken Saro-Wiwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Saro-Wiwa) was an Ogoni and the former president [Goodluck Jonathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodluck_Jonathan) was an Ijaw. Bourne does a good job at avoiding simplistic narratives about "ancient hatreds" throughout his book when explaining the country's shifting political tides.

As Nigeria careened towards independence in 1960 there was oscillating pressure to either centralize or federalize the country. Though a centralizing state would help to reduce the regional imbalances in the country, it would be the target of lobbying efforts by each groups for *their turn to eat*. 

One wonders whether a purely federated Nigerian state would have prevented the civil war from occurring or the unprecedented corruption and environmental damage the oil industry ended up costing the country. 
Though a purely federated state may prevent rent seeking in Lagos/Abuja, but each region had large numbers of minorities in them. How would the Christians feel about sharia law being carried out by the Alkalis in the North and what about the large share of Muslims that lived in Lagos and other areas of Yorubaland? And how would the costs and benefits of the differential resources available to the regions be shared? The discovery of oil reserves in Igboland showed that while money poured into Abuja, the only thing the River States had to show for their endowment was despoiled land for oil spills and poor extraction processes. 

## Independence

Nigeria's independence in 1960 coincided with the 16 other African states that year. It was at the height of the cold war. Lumumba had been overthrown by a coup a month before, the Cuban revolution was still fresh in the minds of the Americans. Luckily, from the Western perspective, the country's first prime minister [Abubakar Tafawa Belawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abubakar_Tafawa_Balewa) was a pious Muslim, conservative, and not at all interested in the Soviet bloc.

> How was it that Balewa became the first elected prime minister of a sovereign Nigeria, in what in retrospect was called the First Republic? Had the British, possibly for Cold War reasons, fixed the 1959 elections so that this cautious and Anglophile northerner, with several wives as a good Muslim and 22 children, became the leader at independence? 

Probably not. Even though the NCNC and AG had enough seats to form a southern coalition, the NPC in coalition with the NCNC remained the governing coalition. Awolowo and and the AG overplayed their hand by trying to make deals with the NPC and NCNC simultaneously. When they were discovered doing so, they were left as the opposition. The Macmillan government was happy enough that Nigeria remain a friendly member of the commonwealth, especially in the backdrop of Nkrumahism in Ghana, white flight in the Belgian Congo, and the apartheid's governments Sharpeville massacre in South Africa shining and international spotlight on racism and colonialism. 

Nigeria was at a crossroad's at independence. Nnamdi Azikiwe in his inaugural address as Governor General appealed to Awolowo and the [Sardauna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadu_Bello) to forge a new country that was "hate-free, fear-free, and greed-free" and act as a shining example on the continent. Yet the dream would fail. In seven years Nigeria would experience two coups and one of the bloodiest civil wars in modern African history. 

> The trouble for Balewa and those trying to make a success of an independent Nigeria was that public expectations were excessive, the economy would have difficulty paying for them, and politics seemed the easiest way to make money. 'Nigeria' was becoming a deadly combination of a zero-sum game and roulette. The honeymoon joy of independence was the prologue to a deepening crisis. 

Though by no means aligned in the Soviet bloc, the Nigerian government began to chart its own foreign policy at odds with its former colonial ruler and NATO bloc. Nigeria became one of the most forceful critics of apartheid and racism more generally. It had protested France's nuclear tests in the Sahara and even temporarily ended diplomatic relations with her in 1963. This slight against France may have been the primary reason for French support of the Biafran rebels four years later. Nigeria would also quickly cancel its defence treaty with the UK and become a full republic with 1963 severing all official links to the British monarchy. 

## Overture to disaster

The political arrangements at the time of independence quickly began to fray within a few years. The NPC was much more successful than the NCNC in getting northerners into military and civil service positions. Cut off from the centre, the NCNC was focused mainly on Igboland. Even the opposition AG split into two halves with Samuel Akintola leading a more "moderate" group that wanted to negotiate with the NPC whereas Awolowo continued to oppose any deals with the federal parliament and supported nationalization of key industries. 

> The United Peoples' Party then morphed into the Nigerian National Democratic Party, not becoming notably more democratic along the way. 

> Okotie-Eboh became notorious, like Kingsley Ozuomba Mbadiwe, Minister of Transport, as one of the 'ten per centers', the ministers who were collecting commissions on projects they approved... He triumphantly survived a storm in the House of Representatives after he had started a shoe factory and then increased the duty on imported shoes. 

The author was able to interview several important people in the book including Maitama Sule, the first and last resource minister who was not corrupt and who helped break up the Shell-BP and 'seven sisters' cartel on oil bidding. Sule also confirmed that Belawa also avoided the temptations of the corruptions. From all accounts Tafawa seems like a Muslim gentleman worthy of his Knighthood. It's important to note that "Balewa completely failed to call any of his ministers to account or punish them for their misdemeanours".

> The dissatisfaction with the Nigerian body politic was widespread, and it was displayed in the press, in the labour movement, in the dubious federal election at the end of 1964 and in its aftermath. At independence, only four years before, it would have been inconceivable that, so few years later, Chief Awolowo would have been incarcerated for treason in the 19th-century prison in Lagos. What few realized was that the anger with the slow pace of decolonisation and the corruption of the politicians was beginning to take hold in the military. 

As Chinua Achebe put it in his book *The Trouble with Nigeria*:

> The trouble with Nigeria is simply and squarely a failure of leadership. There is nothing basically wrong with the Nigerian character. There is nothing wrong with the Nigerian land or climate or water or air or anything else. The Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility, to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership.
