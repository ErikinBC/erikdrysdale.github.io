> Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in kingdom of the well and the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place. (Susan Sontag – Illness as Metaphor)

Like most of other works of antiquity, the writings of Galen and Hippocrates were kept in safe keeping and even expanded upon by the Arab world throughout the European dark ages. At the height of the Islamic enlightenment, the religious view was that Allah does not create a disease that there is not a subsequent cure to discover (an optimistic theology). Al-Razi was a doctor who trained in Baghdad’s bimaristan – “a home of the sick” where he eventually published the *Comprehensive Book of Medicine*. While a great fan of Galen, al-Razi was able to show that some of Galen’s principles were unsound (such as a human body can only get warmer is a hot liquid is drunk) by an improved understanding of chemistry.

The survival of Greek and Roman medical works through Islamic scholarships allowed their rediscovery during the enlightenment at which point men like the Flemish physician Vesalius would help draft the layout for a new science. His masterwork, *De Humani Corporis Fabrica* contained 200 folio illustrations from bone to muscle layers. Even today the illustrations by Johannes Stephanus are beautiful to look at (see below), and we have the inhabitants of the Cemetery of Innocents in Paris to thank for their posthumous contribution. Like so many important persons who advance science, their legacy extends to their pupils, and Vesalius’ student Gabrielle Fallopius was the first to take a detailed undertaking of the study of female generative organs. Indeed fallopian tubes, the placenta, and the vagina are all terms Gabrielle provided us with. Unlike cartography where discovers use the names of friends and family members to label every shoal and rock, Vesalius mainly stuck to using Latin and Greek words to title new medical discoveries.

#### Some beautiful sketches by Stephanus
