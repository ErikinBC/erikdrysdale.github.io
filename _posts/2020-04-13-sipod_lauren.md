In episode 5 of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://statisticallyinsignificant.sounder.fm/show/statistically-insignificant) Jaryd and I are joined by Lauren Erdman who is a PhD student with the [Goldenberg Lab](http://goldenberglab.ca/people.html#openModalLauren) at SickKids hospital. Lauren provides an overview of how machine learning is helping to assist physicians in pediatric medicine. We cover a range of other topics including COVID-19 and the value of the economics discipline.
