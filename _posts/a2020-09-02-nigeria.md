*Nigeria: A new History of a Troubled Century*

As Nigeria careened towards independence there was oscillating pressure to either centralize or federalize the country. A centralized state would instantly have to juggle the three large ethno-regional groups all clamboring for power in the middle (alternating presidences, for example). A purely federated state may prevent rent seeking in Lagos/Abuja, but each region had large numbers of minorities in them. How would the Christians feel about sharia law being carried out by the Alkalis in the North and what about the large share of Muslims that lived in Lagos and other areas of Yorubaland? And how would the costs and benefits of the differential resources available to the regions be shared? The discovery of oil reserves in Igboland showed that while money poured into Abuja, the only thing the River States had to show for their endowment was despoiled land for oil spills and poor extraction processes. 

Glosses over how Nigeria actually got independence, and its context in West Africa more broadly. 

Nigeria's independence in 1960 coincided with the 16 other African states that year. It was at the height of the cold war. Lumumba had been overthrown by a coup a month before, the Cuban revolution was still fresh in the minds of the Americans. Luckily, from the Western perspective, the country's first prime minister [Abubakar Tafawa Belawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abubakar_Tafawa_Balewa) was a pious Muslim, conservative, and not at all interested in the Soviet bloc.

> How was it that Balewa became the first elected prime minister of a sovereign Nigeria, in what in retrospect was called the First Republic? Had the British, possibly for Cold War reasons, fixed the 1959 elections so that this cautious and Anglophile northerner, with several wives as a good Muslim and 22 children, became the leader at independence? 

Probably not. Even though the NCNC and AG had enough seats to form a southern coalition, the NPC in coalition with the NCNC remained the governing coalition. Awolowo and and the AG overplayed their hand by trying to make deals with the NPC and NCNC simultaneously. When they were discovered doing so, they were left as the opposition. The Macmillan government was happy enough that Nigeria remain a friendly member of the commonwealth, especially in the backdrop of Nkrumahism in Ghana, white flight in the Belgian Congo, and the apartheid's governments Sharpeville massacre in South Africa shining and international spotlight on racism and colonialism. 

Nigeria was at a crossroad's at independence. Nnamdi Azikiwe in his inaugural address as Governor General appealed to Awolowo and the [Sardauna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadu_Bello) to forge a new country that was "hate-free, fear-free, and greed-free" and act as a shining example on the continent. Yet the dream would fail. In seven years Nigeria would experience two coups and one of the bloodiest civil wars in modern African history. 

> The trouble for Balewa and those trying to make a success of an independent Nigeria was that public expectations were excessive, the economy would have difficulty paying for them, and politics seemed the easiest way to make money. 'Nigeria' was becoming a deadly combination of a zero-sum game and roulette. The honeymoon joy of independence was the prologue to a deepening crisis. 

Though by no means aligned in the Soviet bloc, the Nigerian government began to chart its own foreign policy at odds with its former colonial ruler and NATO bloc. Nigeria became one of the most forceful critics of apartheid and racism more generally. It had protested France's nuclear tests in the Sahara and even temporarily ended diplomatic relations with her in 1963. This slight against France may have been the primary reason for French support of the Biafran rebels four years later. Nigeria would also quickly cancel its defence treaty with the UK and become a full republic with 1963 severing all official links to the British monarchy. 

## Overture to disaster

The political arrangements at the time of independence quickly began to fray within a few years. The NPC was much more successful than the NCNC in getting northerners into military and civil service positions. Cut off from the centre, the NCNC was focused mainly on Igboland. Even the opposition AG split into two halves with Samuel Akintola leading a more "moderate" group that wanted to negotiate with the NPC whereas Awolowo continued to oppose any deals with the federal parliament and supported nationalization of key industries. 

> The United Peoples' Party then morphed into the Nigerian National Democratic Party, not becoming notably more democratic along the way. 

> Okotie-Eboh became notorious, like Kingsley Ozuomba Mbadiwe, Minister of Transport, as one of the 'ten per centers', the ministers who were collecting commissions on projects they approved... He triumphantly survived a storm in the House of Representatives after he had started a shoe factory and then increased the duty on imported shoes. 

The author was able to interview several important people in the book including Maitama Sule, the first and last resource minister who was not corrupt and who helped break up the Shell-BP and 'seven sisters' cartel on oil bidding. Sule also confirmed that Belawa also avoided the temptations of the corruptions. From all accounts Tafawa seems like a Muslim gentleman worthy of his Knighthood. It's important to note that "Balewa completely failed to call any of his ministers to account or punish them for their misdemeanours".

> The dissatisfaction with the Nigerian body politic was widespread, and it was displayed in the press, in the labour movement, in the dubious federal election at the end of 1964 and in its aftermath. At independence, only four years before, it would have been inconceivable that, so few years later, Chief Awolowo would have been incarcerated for treason in the 19th-century prison in Lagos. What few realized was that the anger with the slow pace of decolonisation and the corruption of the politicians was beginning to take hold in the military.
