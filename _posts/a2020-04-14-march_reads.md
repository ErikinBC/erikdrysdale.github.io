### Book #1: Border by Kapka Kassabova

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/border.jpg" width="16%"></p>
<br>


*Border: A Journey to the Edge of Europe* is a poetic travelogue, starting in Bulgaria and then moving to Greece and Turkey. The lands described at this juncture of civilizations are magical, with witches, mysterious treasures in Thracian tombs, and ghostly villages dotting the landscape. Kassabova is romantic and gypsy-like; she meets an assortment of colourful characters throughout her journey. Perhaps unconscious of their similarities, she relates many of her travel destinations to the same ones taken by the famous Ottoman explorer [Evliya Ã‡elebi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evliya_%C3%87elebi) -- a "boon-companion to mankind" according to his self-description. 

For a solo traveler Kapka seems to receive little male harassment, although many of the locals are continually surprised that she does not have a husband given her age. The people and natural landscape are described in a lovely florid prose. The forests are primordial, and nature reclaims abandoned mines and depopulated villages from post-socialist economic collapse. While the contemporary political response to migrants in Eastern Europe has generally been one of hostility, the people Kapka talks to seem sympathetic to the migrants. They seem to understand that it was they who were fleeing south to the Turkish border rather than across it.  

When Kassabova was growing up, the border between Bulgaria and Turkey was considered the weakest link the Iron Curtain and many Eastern Europeans tried to flee to Turkey. Most were captured, and many were killed. The prospect of escape was especially tantalizing as many holiday-goers would congregate near the Black Sea by Turkish-Bulgarian border, also known as the [Red Riviera](https://tinyurl.com/vbw7v68) in the Eastern Bloc. Many of the characters Kapka meets still have scars left by the Cold War: an instinctual fear of borders and state authority. 

Even after heaving read a [history of Bulgaria](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/history_bulgaria/), I still learned many interesting factoids. In the 1960s Bulgaria was the largest exporter of tobacco in the world. Up until Soviet nationalization, Bulgaria had a near monopoly on [rose attar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_oil) (rose oil).

> For reasons too tied up with soil composition to be quickly grasped, only two regions of the world currently have the right conditions for the *[Rosa damascena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_%C3%97_damascena)*: the plains of upper Thrace in Bulgaria, known as the [Valley of Roses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Valley,_Bulgaria), and Isparta in Turkey. 

While the economic prospects of every industry in Bulgaria suffered during its communist era, the relative decline of Bulgaria's rose cultivation was more pronounced than its tobacco industry which was able to rely on addicted smokers craving the specifically mild and aromatic "Oriental" tobacco that came from the country. Unsurprisingly communist governments tend to be pretty bad at luxury goods (except for *Habanos*?). BULGARIAN POLICY OF REMOVING MUSLIM NAMES: MANY TURKS TOOK ROSE+TOBACCO PRODUCTION TO TURKEY

> The secret is to have three hearts. One for loving people. Another for loving yourself. And the third one, to love the mountains. 

The [Pomaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomaks)

> Just as the communist Bulgarian state had been paranoid that the Pomaks were the fifth column of Turkey and Orientalism, the Greeks had been paranoid that the Pomaks were the fifth column of Bulgaria and communism. To reflect the paranoia of each state, in the second half of the twentieth century the names of Bulgarian Pomaks had been Slavicised (that is, de-Islamicised), while the names of Greek Pomaks had been Turkified (that is, de-Slavicised). Do you follow? Exactly. Hellenised and Slavicised, exoticised and demonised, homogenised and revised by South and North, the Pomaks here had turned to the East. 

I had also learned from Crampton's *Concise History* 


### Book #2: East of the West by Mirsoslav Penkov

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/eastofthewest.jpg" width="16%"></p>
<br>

Miroslav Penkov was born in Bulgaria and moved to United States for university where he has remained ever since. His collection of short stories published in 2011, *East of the West*, is to be found on most English-language book lists for fiction set in Bulgaria. The stories are beautifully written and one can easily spend a leisurely weekend reading the book. Through the stories one feels a closer connection to, and understanding of, the Balkans. I wonder how much of the impressionistic literary landscape was an authentic Bulgaria as opposed to one of the nostalgia of an expatriate. Regardless, western audiences will find Penkov's style of writing will very easy to become absorbed in. 

The ghosts of Balkan history are interlaced through the stories including Ottoman rule (*Devshirme*), the Balkan wars of independence (*Makedonja*), and Communism's rise and fall (*Buying Lenin*). Many of the characters suffer in isolation: an old man who learns of his wife's first husband but cannot talk to her as she has severe dementia, a Bulgarian emigre whose wife leaves him for an American doctor, and a man who is forever to be frustrated in being reunited with his first lover. The self-titled short story, *East of the West*, tells of a tragic romance caused by the legacy of the Balkan Wars, and feels like literary incarnation Kassabova's book *Border* (see above). A village that has grown around both sides of a river finds itself split into two nationalities after the creation of the modern the Bulgarian and Serb nation states. While the communities begin to drift apart slowly over time, there are still annual festivities which draw old families together. There is also the inevitable romantic unions that form between the youth on either sides of the river. After two teenagers fall in love through surreptitious late-night rendezvous, the girl becomes pregnant and both children's respective families ensure that a marriage occurs. Just before the wedding day the bride is shot dead by border guards during an unsuccessful river crossing. As always with the Balkans, people seem to serve history rather than the other way around.
