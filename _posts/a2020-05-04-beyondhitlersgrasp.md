King Boris III was in power during WWII. The son of Bulgaria's first monarch Prince (and later King) Ferdinand, he was a shy man who was more at home carousing in the countryside than issuing orders. As Europe began to careen towards war in the 1930s, Boris decided to put Bulgaria within the German orbit. There were several reasons for this. Bulgaria was economically dependent on Germany (which accounted for half her trade) and her military was been supplied with German weapons. Many of the country's general were pro-German and Fascist, and failing to ally with the Fatherland may have led to a coup. On the other hand, Bulgaria could not afford to antagonize the Soviets. Russia had liberated Bulgaria in 1878 during the Russo-Turkish wars. No Bulgarian would take up arms against the Soviets. Known as the "Fox" for his ability to play sides off against each other. Boris slowly allowed Bulgaria to fall within the German orbit while simultaneously preserving as much independence as possible. 

Bulgaria's history of anti-Semitism is mixed. On the one hand, there were fewer pogroms and antagonism directed to the country's Jews especially when compared to other Eastern European countries. The first King Boris who embraced Christianity in 863 did not persecute the Jews and absorbed many of their practices. Many of the question Boris I sent to Pope Nicholas I were clearly influenced by Jewish ritual:

> What day is the day of rest? What are the proper regulations for the offering of the first fruits? Which animals and poultry may be eaten? Is it wrong to eat the flesh of an animal that has not been slaughtered? Should funeral rites be performed for suicides? For how any days after giving birth is a woman forbidden to her husband?   

After Bulgaria signed the [Tripartite Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_Pact) at the end of 1940, the country was officially part of the military alliance with the Axis powers. German troops were now free to move through the country to attack Greece, which they [did](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Greece) in April 1941. Though Bulgaria's military alliance with the Axis would be unique in that Bulgarian troops would not serve outside of the country. And most amazingly, even after the Germans had invaded the Soviet Union, Bulgaria would never be at war with the USSR and would maintain diplomatic relations throughout.

By March 1941 though, things were beginning to be increasingly ominous for the Jews of Bulgaria. A tripartite of anti-Semitic forces were entrenched in the Bulgarian government: the prime minister [Bogdan Filov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogdan_Filov), the interior minister [Petar Gabrovski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petar_Gabrovski), and [Alexander Belev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Belev) who led the Commissariat of Jewish Affairs (the KEV). All through men were pro-German, hostile to Jewish interests, and in the case of the last two, part of the Bulgarian Fascist organization the [Ratniks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratniks). Gabrovski had sent Belev to Germany to study the Nuremberg laws and he helped draft Bulgarian's equivalent legislation: The Law for the Defence of the Nation ([ZNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_for_Protection_of_the_Nation)). The ZNN stripped Bulgaria's Jews of their economic and political freedoms. Jews were given a special curfew, banned from owning radios, stripped of their bank accounts, and forced to relocate from Sofia, to name but a few. Despite making up a disproportionate number of soldiers in Bulgaria's army during the Balkan wars and WWI, Jews were now longer allowed to serve in the army and were impressed into labour units forced to build roads and other infrastructure. 

The Germans first request for Jews to be deported to the concentration camps was met by resistance in February 1942, as the Bulgarians said they required their labour for the war effort. However, the Jews that were living in the newly acquired territories of Greece would not be as lucky. Around 12,000 Jews from the Greek-occupied territories were to be deported by March 10th. However on the insistence of Belev, Gabrovski also allowed for the deportation of 8,000 other Jews living in Bulgaria who were considered "trouble-makers": any Jew known to be political active. However the Belev plan was to be leaked by numerous Bulgarians to leaders of the Jewish communities. At [Kyustendil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyustendil) on March 9th a delegation of four Bulgarians led by the [Dimitar Peshev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitar_Peshev) left the city in immediate haste to Sofia to convince the prime minister to put a stop to the deportation plan immediately.[[^1]] They knew that had one day to act, as the deportation was scheduled for the next evening. Unable to meet Filov, they instead met the interior minister who denied there was such a deportation plan. After forcing him to call the district governors, the minister eventually put out an order to stop any such deportations. While Gabrovski was of course lying to Peshev and the delegation, Bar-Zohar makes it clear that he had already conferred with the King and Prime Minister and was ready to cancel the order. Gabrovski had no love for the Jews, but he was committed to having any Bulgarian Jews deported without public knowledge as he feared the political backlash from the palace, senior politicians, and a large share of the Bulgarian population who had no antagonism to the Jews. When he first heard that the delegation was on their way, he would have conferred with the prime minister and agreed to begin preparing an exit strategy. 

By the March 10th, news of impending deportations across major Bulgarian cities had spread. The response of the Bulgarian church was tremendous, especially when compared to the Catholic church [at the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler%27s_Pope). The Bulgarian Patriarch (leader of the church), head-quartered in Plovdiv, took a leadership role that would be emulated Metropolitans across the country.

> In the early morning, the news reached the head of the local church, [Metropolitan Kyril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_of_Bulgaria). Strong-willed, ambitious, passionate and courageous, Kyril fearlessly and repeatedly had criticized the government's policy towards the Jews. Back in 1938, he had written a brochure called "Faith and Resolution," condemning  anti-Semitism. A born leader and an independent man, he was among the leaders of the Bulgarian church's opposition to the anti-Jewish policy; but in addition to signing the Saint Synod statements, he also issued his own letters of condemnation again that policy. **He now acted immediately. He sent a telegram to King Boris, asking him to show mercy towards the Jews. He then went out into the streets. At the railway station a special train was to pick up the Jews. According to certain sources, Kyril threatened that if a train loaded with Jews tried to leave the city, he would lie across the rail road tracks... The rebellion by one of the heads of the Church caused great concern in Sofia. This was the first time in Bulgarian history that a prince of the Church had announced his refusal to obey the laws of the country.**



In order to understand why the prime minister and interior minister in conjunction with the military and diplomatic force of the Germans were unable to deport Bulgaria's jews, one needs to understand the power of institutions.
