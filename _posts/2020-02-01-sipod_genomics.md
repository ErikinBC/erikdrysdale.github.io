In episode 3 of the [Statistically Insignificant podcast](https://statisticallyinsignificant.sounder.fm/show/statistically-insignificant), Jaryd and I are joined by a special guest Phil Fradkin has is an expert in computational biology and genetics. We discuss how machine learning techniques are being [leveraged by industry](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/693572v3) to used to identify novel therapeutic candidates. This avenue of research looks especially promising for many rare diseases who genetic variants at the DNA level have been identified but lack targeted treatment pathways.
