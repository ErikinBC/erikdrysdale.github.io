It’s been a good week for the podcast digest. Based on a recommendation from a friend, I subscribed to Malcom Gladwell’s new podcast series [Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com/) and David Axelrod’s ongoing series [The Axe Files](http://politics.uchicago.edu/pages/axefiles).

## Footnotes


[^1]: I’m paraphrasing. However, Begala actually referred to Bush as politically smart due to his courting of Hispanics, even though it was Begala who called Bush “a high functioning moron”, but I think he respected his political instincts.

[^2]: To explain why this answer was an unexpected one, consider that Warren court (noted for its liberal tint) had issued such landmark rulings as *Brown v. Board of Education (1954)* and *Miranda v. Arizona (1966)*.
