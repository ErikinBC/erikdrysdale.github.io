### Book #1: The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/name_of_the_rose.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

I went into reading *The Name of the Rose* with high expectations both because I had enjoyed one of Eco's other works (*Baudalino*) and because the novel is considered one of the author's best. It did not disappoint. Eco's writing style is similar to two of my other favourite authors: Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges. These authors are all thoroughly postmodern and draw heavily on intertextuality (references to other works of literature). *The Name of the Rose* is set in 14th century in Italy at the peak of the High Middle Ages. The historic background is one of total corruption in European society with every strata of the religious hierarchy focused on personal gain rather than religious devotion. The period marked a peak in the tension between the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, with ongoing disagreements about the separation between secular and religious affairs being adjudicated by force, if necessary. Due to a complicated set of political circumstances, the papacy was actually located in [Avignon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon_Papacy) in Southern France throughout most of the 1300s. 

The novel unfolds from the perspective of a Benedictine novice named Adso of Melk. He is travelling under the tutelage of the senior Franciscan friar William of Baskerville who has been requested by the emperor to help adjudicate a dispute between Pope John XXII and various Franciscan sects over the issue of [Apostolic poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_poverty). The parley is scheduled to take place in a week from William's arrival at an abbey designated to be neutral ground in Italy. The reader soon becomes aware that William and Adso are a Holmes and Watson duo (if the Baskerville [toponymic surname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toponymic_surname) wasn't enough of a clue). In the first scene with William, he deftly infers the that abbot's horse has gone missing by observing tracks in the snow and broken branches. When Adso presses to find out the source of William's knowledge, he is told, in so many words, that it is a rather elementary deduction! When they arrive at the abbey, the abbot asks William to conduct an investigation into a monk who is assumed to have been murdered. 

As each day unfolds another monk is found dead and the urgency for the William and Adso duo to solve the murder increases. The book is broken into seven parts (one for each day), and each day is broken into chapters corresponding to the [canonical hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_hours). As the mystery begins to unravel it becomes clear that the source of the conspiracy is related to the abbey's mysterious library, which is described as the greatest in all of Christendom. The library is structured as labyrinth (a reference to Borges quite possibly) so that only the master librarian is able to locate the books. William debates many of the monks as to the ethics of keeping a library's information hidden from scholars. The abbey's view is that knowledge must be regulated to prevent heresies and falsehoods from from polluting Christian thought. Being a disciple of [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon), William's view of natural philosophy is that only those true ideas in accordance with god's majesty will stand the test of debate and inquiry.

The novel has three sorts of scenes. The first are those of any detective procedural where William and Adso are gathering evidence and speculating about motives. The second are long discussions or debates between William and other characters on intellectual subjects including theology, science, politics, and history. Because William appears to have read every book in the middle ages from Latin, Greek, and Arabic sources, he is full of fascinating insights. The third type of scene focuses on the internal state of Adso as he suffers humiliations, strange dreams, and epiphanies about the case. Each help to nicely balance each other out with Adso's naivety being endearing and providing well-needed comic relief. 

While it is hard to describe *The Name of the Rose* as an easy read, it was nevertheless difficult to put down. My paperback ran over 600 pages but I finished it within the same time I usually read 300 page books. It is surprising that a book with hundreds of untranslated Latin expressions and references to long-dead popes and obscure heretical groups became a commercial success. While many parts of the book escaped my comprehension (and no doubt others too), by recreating such a intricate medieval world, Eco allows the reader to feel at home even though the sensory stimulus is at times bewildering. This book was one of the best I have read this year, and it receives my hearty endorsement. 


### Book #2: Africa Since Independence by Paul Nugent

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/africa_since_independence.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

*Africa Since Independence: A Comparative History*. 

Strong emphasis on *comparative*. While Africa is often spoken about, as though it were a country, Nugent makes clear that the trajectories and starting points for African nations were remarkably different. Consider geography. Some countries were tiny (Gambia and Swaziland) whilst others were enormous (Sudan and the Congo: equvilent to Western Europe?). However territory size was not always correlated with population (Sudan had very few people, Nigeria had many). While urbanization was low there were significant variations (see Table 2 Ch 2). As were the nature of the resources available to countries. The institutional differences between French and British Africa were significant. But even within former British colonies there were large political differences. For example those countries which had large white settler minorities (Kenya, Nyasaland, etc), there was much less emphasis placed on getting to universal suffrage. 

One of the main differences between Anglophone and Francophone Africa was how enduring the cultural and economic ties would be. The French were much better, naturally.

Stratified economic development depending on development (North and South Nigeria). Hutus and Tutsis, Northern and Southern Uganda (were Makere is).  

The chapter on comparative economic approaches was one of the most interesting. Nugent contrasts Kenya and Tanzania, the latter pursuing an indigenous policy of African Socialism or *ujamaa*. Neyere's vision was to have happy peasants working in collective *ujamaa* villages. After rural villagers, naturally, failed to show up, the government resorted to more coercive measures. In order to avoid government sanction, peasants would put in a token amount of work on collective farms and then spend the rest of their time. The result was a collapse in agricultural output so that Tanzania went from being a net exporter to a net importer of food. While Nkrumah was also interested in charting a uniquely African-way of socialist development, he considered industrialization as the key for Ghana to escape poverty.

> What other countries have taken three hundred years or more to achieve a more dependent territory must to accomplish in a generation if it is to survive. Unless it is, as it were, jet-propelled, it will lag behind and thus risk everything for which it has fought for. **Capitalism is too complicated a system for a newly independent state. Hence the need for a socialistic society**. 

Ghana's "big push" amounted to borrowing billions of dollars, well above its GDP, in order to finance massive infrastructure projects and [import substitution industrialization](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/L2C_WP18_Ackah-Adjasi-and-Turkson-1.pdf). The results were disastrous. Ghanian industry had no competitive basis beyond government support. The huge investment made into the [Akosombo Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akosombo_Dam) was to fuel an industrial renaissance that never occured. In 1966 Ghana's per capita income was lower than it was at the time of independence (1957). 

In retrospect its clear that the development strategies were not only going to lead to any development. A necessary condition for increasing agricultural output in an underdeveloped economy is have property rights, a stable macroeconomic regime, and economies of scale (i.e. consolidation). The economic dreams of a dictator are bound to fail because there is no course-correction mechanism. After the CCP and TANU won elections in Ghana and Tanzania, respectively, both countries abolished multiparty democracy for a single-party state (the CCP and TANU). If the peasants could have voted, they would have tossed out the party backing the *ujaama* fantasy. Most Ghanians would have preferred better education, healthcare, roads, and electrification, not some grand Soviet industrialization strategy.


### Book #3: Africans by John Iliffe

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/africans.jpg" width="40%"></p>
<br>

*Africans: The History of a Continent*

conflict within generations rather than within hierarchies in West Africa

focus on fertility and population growth

Islam without literacy, so people basically didn't know what was in the Koran. Reminds me of Baudolino about the group that last their bibles

Cool that ironworkers associated with magic!

"competitive" government in pre-historic Africa (note quote from Stanley). Similar to charter city ideas. Competition between states helps to limit autocracy?
