To preface, NeuroTribes as an excellent book. I was first made aware of Steve Silbermanâ€™s work when I heard him on a Science for the People podcast (episode [#345](http://www.scienceforthepeople.ca/episodes/neurotribes) and [#367](http://www.scienceforthepeople.ca/episodes/neurodiversity)). I remember the podcasts well because the host (Rachelle Saunders) started off by asking a question and Silberman would proceed to speak (virtually uninterrupted) for the next sixty minutes. Steve's sheer energy and vast knowledge on the subject left an impression, and I knew I had to seek this book out. I was not disappointed with the result.
