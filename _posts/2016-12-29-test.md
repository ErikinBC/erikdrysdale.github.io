We assume that a given gene expresssion level $G$ for batch $b$, person $i$, and gene $g$ has the following distribution: $G_{b,i,g} \sim N(\gamma_{b,g}^2 \sigma^2_{b,g})$, where the mean and variance parameters of the normal distribution are also random variables with a normal and an inverse-gamma prior distribution, respectively: $\gamma_{b,g}\sim N(Y_b,\tau^2_b)$ and $\sigma^2_{b,g}\sim IG(\lambda_b,\theta_b)$.  As ComBat estimates the parameters of the prior distribution using the data, it takes an [empirical Bayesian approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method). The adjusted data are retrieved as:
