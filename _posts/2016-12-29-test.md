We assume that a given gene expresssion level $G$ for batch $b$, person $i$, and gene $g$ has the following distribution: $G_{b,i,g} \sim N(\gamma_{b,g}^2 \sigma^2_{b,g})$, where the mean and variance parameters of the normal distribution are also random variables with a normal and an inverse-gamma prior distribution, respectively:
