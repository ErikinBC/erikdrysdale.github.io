### Book #3: Men of Honour by Adam Nicholson

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

Nelson: missing an arm, son of a Norfolk parson. Easy going with this crew but anxious. An Achilles BUT a servant of the state. 

Why were the psychologies between the British vs Franco-Spanish fleets so different? The British was desperate to engage in combat, but their ships and numbers weren't any better. 

Nicholson describes nations in terms of group psychology. Spain is backwards with hordes of peasants and effete aristocrats. 25% of Spaniards did not marry and their population increased by only 44% in 18th century whereas Britain's doubled. 

This romantic view seems unaligned with many of the facts: "Half the people ... were either pressed men or miscreants sent on board as part of a quota from each country, and a sixth of the entire fleet would desert or attempt to desert in the coming year (an average kept up throughout the Napoleonic war)."

A lot of naval and ship terminology that is incomprehensible. May be demonstrate all the complicated parts, but did drone on a bit. 

Naval captains received payment in terms of captured ships. Piecemeal pay was common or civil servants. [Henry Digby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Digby_(Royal_Navy_officer)) as an excellent example of someone who got rich. Incentives matter: Nelson sent six ships away to lure out Villeneuve, and the captains of those ships were devastated, not only would they miss out on the glory of battle, they wouldn't receive any desperately needed financial compensation. For many officers of the middle-classes this was essential to secure their future legacy. 

The officers were required to stand at all times, even when their crew "hit the take" as that was what was expected of a gentleman. 

Henry Bayntum channeling sir humphry

> A seaman should be understood to be quite different from all other classes of men, he does not spring up like a Mushroom, it requires many years to make him a seaman, with fatigue both of body and mind. 


> The man of war, as complex as a clock, as large as a prison, as delicate as kite, as strong as a fortress and as murderous as an army, was undoubtedly the most evolved single mechanism, with the most elaborate ordering of parts, the world had ever seen. 

> The three core demands of a navy -- to supply and fit itself; to survive the sea; and to kill the enemy -- were understood in Britain to be part of a single integrated whole. In both Spain and France, that single organism was institutionally divided into conflicting and competing parts. 

Nelson's memorandum to his captains two weeks before battle.
> Something must be left to chance, nothing is sure in a Sea Fight beyond all others. Shot will carry away the mast and yards of friends as well as foes ... Captains are to look to their particular Line as their rallying point. But, in case Signals can neither be seen or perfectly understood, no Captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of an Enemy. 

> Navies reflect the societies from which they come

Why do firms fail: complacency (not enough urgency to change). It's really hard to push people out of their comfort zones. If you instill anxiety rather than urgency, people will retreat even more sharply into their foxholes. 

Eight common mistakes. Underestimating the power of vision, fialing to create short-term wins, and declarin victory to soon. 



### Book #1: Wicked by Gregory Maguire

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/wicked.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

In L. Frank Baum's *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* the novel begins with Dorothy's house being swept up in a tornado and happening to fall in the Land of Oz and crushing the Wicked Witch of the East. Treated a liberator by the locals, she is told that if she wants to return home she must journey along the yellow brick road and talk to the Wizard of Oz. In their meeting Oz offers to help Dorothy return to Kansas on the condition that she kill the Wicked Witch of the West. Dorothy and her compatriots are upset by the nature of the request, but they do not not question the moral legitimacy of their request for violence (the Witch is *bad* after all). But what were the underlying political realities that led Oz to request such an assassination? In *Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West*, Gregory Maguire deftly constructs the world of Oz and tells the story of how Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) comes to hold her position of power in the Vinkus (aka the land of the Winkies). *Wicked* is divided into five chapters, with the story of Elphaba's upbringing in *Munchkinlanders*, her education in *Gillikin*, and her political rebellion in *City of Emeralds*. In the last two books *In the Vinkus* and *The Murder and its Aftermath* Elphaba embraces her witch identity and ultimately comes into conflict when Dorothy when she is given the shoes of the sister Nessarose (the Wicked Witch of the East).

> "What shall we do now?" asked Dorothy sadly.
>
> "There is only one thing we can do," returned the Lion, "and that is to go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy her." 

At the time of Elphaba's birth, Oz rules an imperial state. The previous indigenous ruler, the Ozma Regent, was overthrown in a coup by Oz. He maintains his power over the territories through the use of secret police the Gale Force. Elphaba's father Frexspar is a priest in Munchkinland where he tries to teach the benighted locals the true word of the Unnamed God and of "unionism". They are a difficult flock to manage. Frexspar has to constantly draw the Munchkinlanders away from the pleasure faith religions, [Lurlinism](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Lurline), and various states of debauchery (orgies, binge drinking, etc). Many childhoods are difficult, but being born with green skin makes Elphaba's miserable. She is feared and ostracised by the locals and her parents project their guilt on her. At the university of Shiz Elphaba becomes friends with many of the characters that will be present in the rest of the novel. During this time Oz begins to enact a series of legislation to strip Animals (the conscious animals) of their rights. Elphaba becomes the amanuensis of the goat Dr. Dillamond who is conducting research into the biological foundations of Animals. His work proves too political dangerous and he is assassinated leading to Elphaba's radicalization. Through a series of unplanned events Elphaba eventually assumes the role of a powerful leader in the Vinkus region and her sister becomes the theocratic dictator of Munchkinland. After Nessarose is accidentally killed by Dorothy's tornado-born house, Elphaba worries that her sister's magic shoes may be used by Oz to attempt a reunification of Munchkinland. Her increasingly deranged pursuit of Dorothy and the shoes leads to Elphaba's well-known downfall.

The writing in *Wicked* is excellent on many levels. The characters are vibrant and the dialogue is witty. The author strikes the right balance between world creation and accessibility. While not *Game of Thrones*, I enjoyed the political and cultural forces at play in the land of Oz especially around Animal rights and religion. Maguire's vocabulary is immense and I found myself frequently looking up words like: ormolu, usufruct, bartizzan, palaver, sybarite, badinage, etiolated, and disport. The fourth wall is often broken with many references to our world including President Truman and Keats (*"My silken flanks tarted up with garlands or the like"*). The first three chapters are especially page-turners. *Wicked* is very much an adult's fairytale story. Extreme violence is ubiquitous and life is cheap. The Oz world resembles the high middle ages or the renaissance, where there are some modern institutions (universities, stock exchanges) but political accountability is non-existent. Magic or no magic, *Wicked* does a fantastic job at showing how the calculus of power works and its impact on politics and culture. Maguire's first book in *The Wicked Years* is a masterpiece.
