* Introduction: there is an impermanence to growth. Sharma takes the long view. Even successful economies of the past (early industrializing Germany and Japan) had long periods of stagnation. 
* Focus on BC (before the crisis) to AC (after the crisis). In BC, we all had an illusion that there would be economic convergence between developing and developed world. China would continue to grow quickly on its way to becoming the newest superpower, and it's voracious appeitite for commodities would lift lead to prosperity from Moscow to Lagos. The story was short-lived, commodity prices crashed in 2014, and they have never really recovered. Most developing world countries like South Africa and Brazil now have lower growth rates than the United States. Convergence is dead. 
* In the BC era, it looked as if the macroeconomy was taking care of itself. There was even talk in 2005 that the IMF may no longer need to provide emergency assistance as there were no country crises that year. Arthur mMiller said that an era has reached its end "when its basic illusions are exhausted".
