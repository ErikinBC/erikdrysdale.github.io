Anyone who reads Italo Calvino will appreciate that is style is completely original, yet difficult to describe. There are certainly elements of the fabulous and absurd. Yet the author's style also evolved over time. His first novel, *The Path to the Spider's Nest* (1947) was written in the neorealist style of the other Italian authors of that period. Yet over the 1950s Calvino's stories became increasingly fantastic as [demonstrated](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/nonexistent/) in the [heraldic trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Ancestors). The move to Paris in 1967 gave Calvino a new set of influences including the French [New Novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveau_roman) and the [Oulipo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo) movement (of which Calvino was a founding member). The method of constrained writing is most beautifully exemplified in *[The Castle of Crossed Destinies](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/bookreview_castle/)* (1969), in which the stories of the characters is connected the unfolding tarot card spread. Calvino was writing novels and stories up to the point of his untimely death in 1985. 

The collection of short stories and novellas in *Difficult Loves and Marcovaldo* spans a good deal of Calvino's career. *Difficult Loves* (1957) comprises of eleven stories that range from a bizarre erotic encounter in *The adventure of a soldier* to a Calvino-esque battle of the sexes in *The adventure of the reader*. The quality of the stories varies; my initial impression being that these represented early attempts at Calvino finding his surrealist and post-modern style. Yet they were written after *The Cloven Viscount* and *The Baron in the Trees*, two shorter novels which in which I assumed the author had perfected his craft. Because Calvino was willing to write short stories throughout his career, there are inevitably ones that will feel below standard. Yet some of my perceived quality differences in no doubt related to my own preferences for the type of story and prose I expect from the author.

Written a year after *Difficult Loves* but several years before the environmental movement went mainstream,[[^1]] *Smog* (1958) is arguably the best novella in the collection. It was both prescient for its time and remarkably suitable for today's climate change era. The story focuses on a nameless narrator who writes for the magazine *Purification*, which is owned by a local industrialist Commendatore Corda. The magazine supports any technocratic solution to the problem that remains consistent with Corda's business model and industrial capitalism. The proprietor of *Purification* has shrewdly realized that narrative control are cost-effective ways to control the policy agenda. Corporations today have become sophisticated operators at this game through the use of cynical ploys like [corporate social responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility) and the diversity training [hustle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Fragility). 

The unnamed narrator is also pursued, literally, by the beautiful and wealthy Claudia who is unsure why he is so elusive to her affections. Our narrator is startled when Claudia calls him in this new city, but he appears resigned to her possessing an omniscience as to his whereabouts. In order to ensure she has not mistakenly fallen in love with a poor man of no social standing, Claudia refuses to see the narrator for who he is. Our protagonist is disempowered by not only his lover but also the economic system. Like other Calvino male characters, they possess a Hamlet-like psyche that allows them to analyse their situation to a painful level of details whilst possessing no agency to change events. *Smog* has some parallels with Calvino's other excellent novella [*The Argentine Ant*](https://classic.esquire.com/article/1960/10/1/the-argentine-ant) which connects environmental disorder to institutional failure. 

*A plunge into real estate* is the longest story in the book (around 90 pages) and returns to a neorealist style the author practised decades early. Yet I found myself deeply enjoying the book which has an explicit class dimension between bookish Quinto and the real estate developer Caisotti. The latter is described as a peasant who has made his way down from mountains and has managed to become an important player in the market through sheer determination and unscrupulous practices (Ã  la Duddy Kravitz). Part of the fun of the novel is waiting to see the way in which Caisotti will defraud Quinto despite the latter's attempts at vigilance to the former.

> Quinto was delighted to heart that Caisotti was such a scoundrel. The charm of business, it was just coming to him, was precisely that it brought one into contact with people of all sorts. It meant dealing with crooks and knowing that they were crooks, making sure that they didn't cheat you, and indeed, if the opportunity occurred, cheating them. 

The last work in the collection is *Marcovaldo* which comprises of twenty chapters which follow the eponymous character's trials and tribulations in an unspecified city in northern Italy. Marcovaldo's adventures are frequently incredible and have an degree of slap stick humour that was unexpected but enjoyable. Though each work is enjoyable on its own, their feels to be little cohesion between the different stories. Surely *Smog* should have been paired with *The Argentine Ant*? There is also no introduction to the book, which one would expect given the works were translated decades apart from each other and by two different translators. Though each of the works is good on its own, I would suggest that readers interested in Calvino's work reader some of his [more](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/distance_of_moon/) [famous](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/invisible_cities/) stories first before attending to these.
