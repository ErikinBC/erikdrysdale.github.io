It’s been a while since I read *Othello*, though I would put it in my top five of favourite Shakespeare plays for several reasons. First, the play clips along at a good pace and avoids scenes of unnecessary comic relief or a longwinded songs from the king’s fool.[[^1]] Second, like the *Merchant of Venice* it’s set in the context of the Republic of Venice in the late 16th century so it is appealing from a historical perspective.[[^2]] Note that Othello has also been well done on the screen in the last 20 years with an excellent [Hollywood version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIIjya_5Oro) with Othello and Iago played by Laurence Fishburne and Kenneth Branagh, respectively, as well as a [Shakespeare Retold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIcCE3s_rFc) BBC version too.

## Footnotes


[^1]: For example in *The Tempest* there is, in my view, a little too time spent following drunks about their island and listening to their bawdy talk. On another note, both plays *Othello* and the *Merchant of Venice* are interesting in that they focus on racial/cultural outsiders (Othello being African and Shylock being Jewish) in a modern city-state. 

[^2]: Economists are particularly interested in Republican Venice as it was one of the first modern economies with a sophisticated financial system and international trade networks. Additionally, with the revival in institutional economics the Venetian Republic provides an interesting case study as to how the political system can became rent-seeking (or extractive), as discussed in *Why Nations Fail* by Acemoglu and Robinson. 

[^3]: As critics have pointed out, when the play is supposed to occur matters for how we interpret the play. In actual history, Cyprus was conquered by the Ottomans in 1570, so if Othello is sailing there in 1569, it could be an indication that his demise augured the fall of Cyprus.
