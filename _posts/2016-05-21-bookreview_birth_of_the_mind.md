The risk of reading a book written in 2004 about the biology and genetic origins of the brain, which was only a few years after the entire human genome was sequenced, is that the studies and research cited can become deprecated in a field advancing with leaps and bounds. Luckily, Gary Marcus’ *The Birth of the Mind* avoids falling into this phenomena, and instead provides an excellent overview in understanding how genes are fundamental in determining the structure of our species’ most important organ (or according to Woody Allen, his second) as well as the similarities and differences with those of other animals. If I could summarize this book with one quote from a chapter title page it would be:

> “The genetic code is not a blueprint for assembling a body from a set of bits; it is more like a recipe for baking one from a set of ingredients. If we follow a particular recipe, word for word, in a cookery book, what finally emerges from the oven is a cake. We cannot now break the cake into its component crumbs and say: this crumb corresponds to the first word in the recipe; this crumb corresponds to the second word in the recipe, etc.”
