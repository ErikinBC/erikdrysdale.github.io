They had slipped into marriage as though there could be no other possible resolution of such an encounter. Yet -- supposing she had known him better? Supposing she had known him for a year and during that time observed him in all his other relationships? **She would have hesitated, thinking the net of his affections too widely spread to hold the weighty accompaniment of marriage.**

> "Why be interested in people's private lives? What they are pleased to let us know should be enough for us."
