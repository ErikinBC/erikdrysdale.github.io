### Book #1: A Man of the People by Chinua Achebe

One of the things I found most surprising about the book was how hard it was to fit into the label of "anti-colonial" literature to which Achebe is often elevated. It is true that in his first, and most celebrated novel, *Things Fall Apart*, the colonial authorities are presented in a nuanced but critical light. However in *A Man of the People*, there is little reference to the negative legacy of colonialist. If anything, had the book been written by Niall Ferguson, I suspect would be described as neo-colonial for two reasons. First, the protagonist suggests that many of the political pathologies of post-independence Africa are driven by the voters: it's our turn to eat (cite book). There is a classic experiment in game theory... . Achebe suggests that the African polity is stuck in the low equilibrium game whereby at alternate turns the seeds of growth are eaten, ensuring the pie does not grow. Furthermore, the references to the colonial era, range from neutral to positive. Odili and his friends (Max) were educated at mission schools, and this "Western" education is one of the reasons they are presented as being less corrupt. The characters who served as employees of the colonial estate, while presented as out-of-touch, nevertheless have a certain level of integrity. There are also elements of the dialogue where the topic is explicitly broached.

>
> 'Well no. The trouble is that he hasn't got very much out of the Independence personally. There simply weren't any white posts in his profession that he could task over. There is only one bishop in the entire diocese and he is already an African.'

Again, if this had been written by Niall Ferguson, I presume the book would be reviewed quite differently. X has argued that Chinua Achebe's stance of colonialism became more nuanced over his career. But this book was published in 1966, six years after Nigeria's independence and the last year Nkruman was in office in Ghana, and arguably the height of [Pan-Africanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Africanism). Yet Achebe was already remarkably cynical about the political prospects of an independent Africa.

> Guy's natural warmth towards everyone could easily be misinterpreted. She had herself had taken it for granted that it was for her alone. They had slipped into marriage as though there could be no other possible resolution of such an encounter. Yet -- supposing she had known him better? Supposing she had known him for a year and during that time observed him in all his other relationships? **She would have hesitated, thinking the net of his affections too widely spread to hold the weighty accompaniment of marriage.**

> "Why be interested in people's private lives? What they are pleased to let us know should be enough for us."
>
> "Well, I just am. You're interested in ideas' I in people. If you were more interested in people, you might not like them so much."

Harriet is religious, Guy is an atheist who believes religion is designed to keep the poor poor and the rich rich.
