<br>

Its sweet the way that Ugwu tries to prevent his master from having another affair. While he develops a sense of superiority, he continues to his his Master and Madam as gods.

Didn't appreciate the importance of wigs in female beauty. 

The Biafran people are seen as sympathetic. There are glimpses though that the elites are corrupt. Madu and Kainene talk about how Ojukwo has government officials arrested so he can sleep with their wives. Olanna sees Professor Ezeka  and his wife living in opulent luxury and she is offered cake.
