<br>

Bucharest behaves as though it were one organic entity. 

> The end of June brought a dry and dusty heat to Bucharest... Each day began with a fierce, white light splintering in between the blinds and shutters. By noonday, the ingot of the sun dissolved in the sky as in a vat of molten silver... When the offices closed for the midday meal, the tramway cars were hung with clerks fighting their way homes to darkened bedrooms. At five, when the atmosphere was like felt, the offices reopened, but the rich and the workless remained inactive until evening.

Expects the reader to know who historic figures were, e.g. [Sir Stafford Cripps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Cripps).

Both the locals and the English expats are hostile towards Soviet intentions, Guy excluded, and Romania abandons the notion that Britain will protect her in exchange for the Germans. Hitler orders that Romania hand over the territories and the population goes into mourning.
