### Book #1: The Great Fortune by Olivia Manning

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/thegreatfortune.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

My first introduction to Olivia Manning's *Fortunes of War* cycle was the well-made [TV series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortunes_of_War_(TV_series)) with Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson. Despite being hesitant to read a book series that I have already seen the film adaptation of, the choice to read *The Great Fortune* was a good one.[[^1]] In the first book of the *Balkan Trilogy* Manning introduces the reader to Guy and Harriet Pringle, a recently married couple who have just come to Bucharest as the Second World War is beginning. Guy works for the [British Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Council) and his official job is to teach English at the University of Bucharest. The Council was an instrument of Britain's soft power and had the goal of creating "a basis of friendly knowledge ... which will lead to a sympathetic appreciation of British foreign policy".[[^2]] The Pringle's inhabit a world of colourful characters. The British expats are a motley cohort of university professors, spies, and street smart foreign correspondents. Refugees are to be found everywhere in Bucharest. There are destitute Poles who have fled from the German invasion and former German nobility who lost their estates after the Soviets [occupied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_Bessarabia_and_northern_Bukovina) Bessarabia and Bukovina in June 1940.[[^3]] The Romanian royalty is shown to be effete and debauched. Pre-war Romania is a dysfunctional and uncertain place. [Carol II's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_II_of_Romania) regime is corrupt and incompetent with the majority of the urban population living in squalor. In one amusing scene, reminiscent of Evelyn Waugh's *[Scoop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoop_(novel))*, Minister Ionescu gives a press conference in which he attempts to create a set of alternate facts around the assassination of Prime Minister [CÄƒlinescu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armand_C%C4%83linescu).

> "And may we enquire who executed the assassins--no doubt without a trial?"
>
> Ionescu grew grave again. He recited quickly: "The military, and with grief and indignation at the murder of a beloved Prime Minister, seized the young me and, unknown to the civil authorities, shot them out of hand."
>
> "Is that official?"
>
> "Certainly."
>
> Someone asked: "Are you aware the bodies are being displayed at this moment down in the market-place? Do you approve of that sort of thing?"
>
> Ionescu shrugged: "The military here is powerful. We dare not interfere."
>
> "I saw the bodies," said Galpin. "They looked to me pretty old for students."
> 
> "In this country we have students of all ages. Some remain at the university all their lives."

As the drama of the war unfolds in the background, Harriet begins to question the basis of her relationship with Guy. She quickly becomes aware that any affection Guy displayed during their courtship will not be sustained. Though his generosity is unlimited, he is not able to distinguish giving between those closest to him and strangers in the street. Harriet craves a selfish and private love that is inimical to Guy's nature and his politics as a Communist. Like many true believers, Guy was undaunted by Stalin's [purges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge) and has complete faith in Soviet foreign policy. Yet his political beliefs do not deter him from befriending wealthy Jewish bankers or ne'er do wells like Prince Yakimov, a [White Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_%C3%A9migr%C3%A9) who scrounges at every opportunity to finance his conspicuous consumption. 

> Guy's natural warmth towards everyone could easily be misinterpreted. She had herself had taken it for granted that it was for her alone. They had slipped into marriage as though there could be no other possible resolution of such an encounter. Yet -- supposing she had known him better? Supposing she had known him for a year and during that time observed him in all his other relationships? **She would have hesitated, thinking the net of his affections too widely spread to hold the weighty accompaniment of marriage.**

As Guy is always busy with his work or students, Harriet finds herself bored and restless. She finds herself attracted, not necessarily in a romantic sense, to men like Clarence Lawson who also have a more selfish view of love. However, Clarence is a nihilist, and Harriet instinctively creates distance between them as she knows he is someone who brings people down rather than raising them up. Their differences extend to the theological realm as well. Harriet is religious and Guy is an atheist who believes religion is designed to keep the poor poor and the rich rich. Because Guy cares about everyone, who cares about no one in particular.

> "Why be interested in people's private lives? What they are pleased to let us know should be enough for us."
>
> "Well, I just am. You're interested in ideas' I in people. If you were more interested in people, you might not like them so much."

Despite their difficulties the Pringle's remain deeply attached to each other throughout the first book. It is difficult to imagine that Guy and Harriet as a couple in peacetime England given their differences. But in a time of war, living in a city with only several dozen of your fellow countrymen, intimacy would seem to be an irresistible requirement of the human condition. Manning's *The Great Fortune* is a brilliant book because it shows the impersonality of world events whilst putting a human drama at the centre of a story. 


### Book #2: Difficult Loves and Marcovaldo by Italo Calvino

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/difficultloves.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

*Difficult Loves* short stories in a familiar style Calvino's other short stories: post-modern. 

Two novellas: *Smog* and *A plunge into real estate*. The former is similar to the ant story. The latter is a departure from the rest of the book and is neo-realist.

*Marcovaldo* is fantastical like Calvino's other works, but has a large degree of slap stick and physical humour as well. 

### Book #3: The Spoilt City by Olivia Manning

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/thespoiltcity.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

Bucharest behaves as though it were one organic entity. 

> The end of June brought a dry and dusty heat to Bucharest... Each day began with a fierce, white light splintering in between the blinds and shutters. By noonday, the ingot of the sun dissolved in the sky as in a vat of molten silver... When the offices closed for the midday meal, the tramway cars were hung with clerks fighting their way homes to darkened bedrooms. At five, when the atmosphere was like felt, the offices reopened, but the rich and the workless remained inactive until evening.

Expects the reader to know who historic figures were, e.g. [Sir Stafford Cripps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Cripps).

Both the locals and the English expats are hostile towards Soviet intentions, Guy excluded, and Romania abandons the notion that Britain will protect her in exchange for the Germans. Hitler orders that Romania hand over the territories and the population goes into mourning.
