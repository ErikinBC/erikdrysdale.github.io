<br>

<br>

> Guy's natural warmth towards everyone could easily be misinterpreted. She had herself had taken it for granted that it was for her alone. They had slipped into marriage as though there could be no other possible resolution of such an encounter. Yet -- supposing she had known him better? Supposing she had known him for a year and during that time observed him in all his other relationships? **She would have hesitated, thinking the net of his affections too widely spread to hold the weighty accompaniment of marriage.**

> "Why be interested in people's private lives? What they are pleased to let us know should be enough for us."
>
> "Well, I just am. You're interested in ideas' I in people. If you were more interested in people, you might not like them so much."

Harriet is religious, Guy is an atheist who believes religion is designed to keep the poor poor and the rich rich. 

### Book #2: Difficult Loves and Marcovaldo by Italo Calvino

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/difficultloves.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

*Difficult Loves* short stories in a familiar style Calvino's other short stories: post-modern. 

Two novellas: *Smog* and *A plunge into real estate*. The former is similar to the ant story. The latter is a departure from the rest of the book and is neo-realist.

*Marcovaldo* is fantastical like Calvino's other works, but has a large degree of slap stick and physical humour as well. 

### Book #3: The Spoilt City by Olivia Manning

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/thespoiltcity.jpg" width="13%"></p>
<br>

Bucharest behaves as though it were one organic entity. 

> The end of June brought a dry and dusty heat to Bucharest... Each day began with a fierce, white light splintering in between the blinds and shutters. By noonday, the ingot of the sun dissolved in the sky as in a vat of molten silver... When the offices closed for the midday meal, the tramway cars were hung with clerks fighting their way homes to darkened bedrooms. At five, when the atmosphere was like felt, the offices reopened, but the rich and the workless remained inactive until evening.

Expects the reader to know who historic figures were, e.g. [Sir Stafford Cripps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Cripps).

The book starts with the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia and Bukovina. Both the locals and the English expats are hostile towards Soviet intentions, Guy excluded, and Romania abandons the notion that Britain will protect her in exchange for the Germans. Hitler orders that Romania hand over the territories and the population goes into mourning.
