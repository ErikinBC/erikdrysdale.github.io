In clinical settings understanding the dynamics of survival times is important to both medical practitioners as well as patients. In statistics, time-to-event (or duration) analysis models a continuous random variable $T$, which represents the the length of a state. If the state is being alive, then the time to event is mortality, and we refer to it as [survival anaylsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis). If $t$ is a given realization of $T$, then we are conceptually interested in modelling $P_\theta(T>t\|X)$, indexed by some parametric distribution $\theta$ and conditional of some baseline covariates $X$. If a patient has a "state" of some form of cancer, then survival analysis answers the question: what is the probability that life expectancy will exceed $t$ months given your baseline features $X$ (age, gender, genotype, etc) and underlying biological dynamics $\theta$.[^1]
 
If $T$ is a continuous random variable, then it has a CDF and PDF of course, but in survival analysis we are also interested in two other functions (dropping the subscripts/conditional variables for notational simplicity):
 
1. **Survivor function**: $S(t)=1-F(t)$. Probability of being alive at time $t$. 
2. *Hazard function**: $h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$. The rate of change of risk, given you are alive at $t$.
 
Visualizing each function in `R` provides a useful way to understand what each function tells us. Assume that $T~\text{Exp}(\theta)$ distribution.

[^1]: That is, if there were two datasets of survival times, one with breast and pancreatic cancer, respectively, then we would expect that probability of survival would be lower in the latter group, even with the same covariates, simply because pancreatic cancer is known to be a more aggressive cancer.
