The topic of Canadian real estate prices in the news media has been centered on the rate of house price growth in Toronto and Vancouver. In August 2016 and June 2017, Vancouver and Toronto real estate prices were growing by a year-on-year rate of 26% and 29%, respectively. As with most property booms, there were corresponding social and political consequences alongside the economic ones. Housing resales exploded as long-term homeowners saw their home valuations reach unimaginable levels and decided to cash in for an early retirement. While the number of real estate agents boomed, social trust in the profession plummeted as a [variety of illegal or unethical practices](https://globalnews.ca/news/2505021/some-b-c-real-estate-agents-laundering-cash-ndp/) were being identified including fraud, insider trading, shadow flipping,[[^1]] avoiding property transfer and capital gains taxes, and avoiding anti-money laundering protocols. 

In Canada no capital gains tax is paid on an individual's [principal residence](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-127-capital-gains/principal-residence-other-real-estate/sale-your-principal-residence.html) meaning an historic amount of government revenue has been lost by the permanent tax expenditure. While there are a variety of theoretical public policy reasons for exempting a family's house from capital gains tax, the fact that this privilege is independent of the price of the home, the amount of profit made on the sale, the number of years lived in the house, or the overall income or wealth of the owner is highly regressive and unfortunate. As has been known since Roosevelt's New Deal, the key to maintaining a capitalist democracy is that a growth in private wealth and income translates into a higher level of public investment and services: *a rising tide lifts all boats*. A general increase in property prices disproportionately benefits the wealthy (who own the majority of property) and the few lucky specialists of the markets (real estate agents, architects, developers, builders, etc). While some of this is captured in public revenue through property taxes and land-transfer taxes, this is a pittance compared to the massive accumulation of private wealth.

Increases in land values are more akin to lottery winnings than productive investments. When the price of an Apple or Google stock rises, this usually corresponds to a true increase in the productive capacity of those organizations: new products, better algorithms, etc. Were these profits to be taxed too highly it would diminish the level of investment in real economic activity. While land prices may rise due to real economic work (such as tilling farm land or maintenance), in most major cities prices go up because investors want to own real estate assets in that jurisdiction, or a large corporation plans on head-quartering there. In this case, even if 100% of the gains in land values were taxed, it would not discourage real economic activity (although it would decrease liquidity). The fundamental rule of an optimal tax regime is to tax inelastic goods and services. A whole economic movement [led by Henry George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism) in the 19th century advocated governments raise revenue through taxing land and the classical economists like Adam Smith have noted that such a tax would lead to limited economic inefficiencies. Since municipal land is basically inelastic, this suggests it should be taxed. Of course the construction of buildings and infrastructure represents real and valuable economic activity and it would be foolish to discourage this valuable service. This is why in Australia foreign persons are required to apply through the [Foreign Investment Review Board](http://firb.gov.au/real-estate/) and can only buy new properties. Their stated principles are quite revealing:


> The Government's policy is to channel foreign investment into new dwellings as this creates additional jobs in the construction industry and helps support economic growth. It can also increase government revenues, in the form of stamp duties and other taxes, and from the overall higher economic growth that flows from additional investment. Foreign investment applications are therefore generally considered in light of the overarching principle that the proposed investment should increase Australia's housing stock (**be creating at least one new additional dwelling**). Consistent with this aim, different factors apply depending on whether the type of property being acquired will increase the housing stock or whether it is an established dwelling. 

As with any asset boom, social tensions grow between the haves and the have-nots. This is especially pronounced when the asset if a commodity required by all citizens to live such as food or housing. In contrast to equity booms, like the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), the growth in a stock-class may benefit a sliver of the population, but it does not lead to significant regional inequalities. Whereas the growth of Silicon Valley has translated in the higher property prices for the entire Bay Area, leading to a mass exodus of middle class families. Imagine two neighbours John and Jane living side-by-side -- one a renter and one who has owned their home for a decade. John rents his home from an owner he has only met once and he probably lives abroad. While his rent increases for John are limited by
